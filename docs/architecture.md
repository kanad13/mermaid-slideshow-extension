# Architecture

This document describes the design decisions and architectural patterns used in the Lightweight Markdown Preview extension.

## Overview

The extension provides a lightweight, secure markdown preview directly within VS Code. It prioritizes simplicity, security, and performance over feature breadth. The entire implementation is contained in a single extension file with no external dependencies beyond the `marked` markdown parser.

## High-Level Architecture

```
User opens markdown file
         ↓
Command: "Show Lightweight Markdown Preview"
         ↓
Extension creates/reuses single webview panel
         ↓
User edits markdown → onDidChangeTextDocument fires
         ↓
updateWebviewContent() renders markdown to HTML
         ↓
Webview displays rendered content with Mermaid/MathJax
```

**Design principle:** One active webview panel per extension session, reused across different markdown files. This minimizes resource consumption and simplifies state management.

## Security Model

The security model assumes that any markdown file could be malicious. The extension uses a defense-in-depth strategy to mitigate risks, primarily Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

### Layer 1: Content Security Policy (CSP) with Nonces

The extension enforces a strict CSP that only allows scripts with a unique, randomly-generated `nonce` (number used once) to run.

- **How it works:** A new cryptographic nonce is generated for every preview render. This nonce is included in the CSP `meta` tag and in every legitimate `<script>` tag.
- **Effect:** Any malicious `<script>` tag injected within the markdown will not have the correct nonce and will be blocked by the browser from executing.

### Layer 2: Safe HTML Parsing

The `marked` parser sanitizes input by escaping HTML, turning potentially executable code into inert text.

- **Example:** `<script>alert('xss')</script>` becomes `&lt;script&gt;alert('xss')&lt;/script&gt;`

### Layer 3: Trusted External Scripts

Mermaid and MathJax are loaded from trusted CDNs (jsDelivr), not from user-controlled content. The extension never executes user-provided JavaScript.

### Layer 4: VS Code Sandbox

The entire preview is sandboxed by VS Code, preventing access to the file system or other sensitive resources.

## State Management

The extension's state is managed entirely in memory and is reset every time the extension is reloaded.

### Lifecycle

1. **Initialization:** When the user runs the "Show Preview" command, the extension creates a single webview panel.
2. **State Variables:** Two key variables are set in a closure:
   - `currentPanel`: Holds the reference to the active webview.
   - `currentDocument`: Holds the reference to the text document being previewed.
3. **Event Listening:** An `onDidChangeTextDocument` listener is registered to watch for edits.
4. **Update Cycle:** When the document changes, the listener triggers an update:
   - A new CSP `nonce` is generated.
   - The markdown content is parsed and rendered into a full HTML document.
   - The webview's HTML is replaced with the new content.
5. **Disposal:** When the user closes the panel, the listener is removed and the `currentPanel` variable is set to `null`, releasing its resources.

## Content Processing Pipeline

1. **Extraction:** Mermaid and math blocks are extracted and preserved before markdown parsing (prevents escaping of special syntax)
   - Mermaid supports dual syntax: GitHub-style (` ```mermaid `) and Azure DevOps-style (`::: mermaid`)
2. **Rendering:** `marked` converts markdown to HTML
3. **Restoration:** Preserved blocks are restored with original delimiters intact
4. **Path Resolution:** Image `src` attributes are converted to webview-accessible URIs, handling:
   - Relative paths (`./images/photo.png`)
   - Parent directory paths (`../docs/diagram.png`)
   - Workspace-root paths (`/assets/icon.png`)
   - HTTPS URLs and data URIs (unchanged)

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Approach
- **Full re-render on every change:** The entire markdown is re-parsed and HTML regenerated
- **Why:** Ensures consistency and simplicity. Given typical markdown file sizes (< 10 MB), this is fast enough
- **Cost:** ~10-50ms for typical documents on modern hardware

### Optimization Opportunities
For future enhancements with scroll-position syncing or large file support:
- **Virtual rendering:** Only render visible sections of the preview
- **Incremental updates:** Track which sections changed and re-render only those
- **Debouncing:** Batch rapid edits to reduce render frequency
- **Web Worker:** Off-load markdown parsing to a background thread

## UI & Navigation Design

### Table of Contents Sidebar (Collapsible Overlay)

The extension provides an optional table of contents sidebar that users can toggle on-demand. Rather than permanently occupy screen space, the sidebar overlays content when open—similar to mobile hamburger menu patterns familiar to most users.

#### Design Philosophy

**Why Overlay Instead of Fixed Layout:**
- **Content-first:** Content width remains constant regardless of sidebar state, providing consistent reading experience
- **Simplicity:** Avoids layout reflow complexity, coordinate system bugs, and animation sync issues
- **Low maintenance:** Fewer CSS rules and interaction states reduce code fragility
- **User control:** Users get full screen width for reading when they don't need the outline

**Why Collapsible at All:**
- Long documents benefit from quick access to structure without scrolling through headings
- Users can reference the outline while reading without losing scroll position
- Keyboard users can navigate via Escape key without reaching for mouse

#### Key Interactions

- **Toggle:** Click hamburger button to open/close sidebar
- **Close:** Click sidebar close button, overlay backdrop, or press Escape key
- **Navigate:** Click any outline link for smooth scroll to heading
- **Track:** Current heading highlighted automatically as user scrolls content
- **Collapse/Expand:** Parent headings with children show a disclosure triangle; sections collapsed by default; clicking the triangle toggles visibility; scrolling to a heading auto-expands its collapsed parent sections
- **Hierarchy indicators:** Pound-sign prefixes (#, ##, ###) indicate heading depth at a glance, styled in muted monospace to avoid visual clutter

#### Collapsible TOC Implementation

The TOC uses native HTML `<details>/<summary>` elements for collapsibility:
- **Zero-JS toggle:** Browser-native toggle mechanism, no custom JavaScript for expand/collapse
- **Collapsed by default:** No `open` attribute on `<details>` elements, keeping the outline compact on first open
- **Tree-based generation:** Headings are built into a parent-child tree (via `buildTOCTree()`), then rendered recursively (via `renderTOCNode()`). Parent nodes wrap children in `<details>/<summary>`, leaf nodes render as plain items.
- **Link/toggle separation:** `e.stopPropagation()` on link clicks prevents `<details>` toggle when navigating, so clicking the heading text scrolls without collapsing
- **Auto-expand on scroll:** When IntersectionObserver activates a heading inside a collapsed section, `updateActiveTOC()` walks up ancestor `<details>` elements and opens them

#### Performance & Accessibility

- **Animation:** Uses GPU-accelerated `transform` for smooth, jank-free slide transition
- **No layout shifts:** Overlay pattern means zero reflows during open/close
- **Keyboard-friendly:** Escape key closes sidebar; Enter/Space on `<summary>` toggles sections; semantic HTML enables screen reader navigation
- **Theme-aware:** Button styling respects light/dark themes without special handling needed

## Guidelines for Future Changes

To maintain the extension's stability and security, follow these guidelines.

### Safe to Modify

The following areas are generally safe for modification and extension:
- **Styling:** Adjusting CSS for elements like the body, code blocks, and tables
- **Markdown Options:** Passing new configuration options to the `marked()` parser
- **VS Code Settings:** Adding new user-configurable settings in `package.json`
- **New Commands:** Adding new commands in `package.json` and implementing them in `extension.js`
- **Sidebar Styling:** Adjusting colors, spacing, or hover effects in `.toc-sidebar` or `.toc-link` classes

### Requires Security Review

Changes to the following areas are high-risk and **must undergo a security review**. They form the core of the extension's security and stability:
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Modifying the CSP header can instantly create security vulnerabilities
- **Nonce Generation:** The cryptographic token logic is critical for preventing XSS
- **Mermaid/Math Preprocessing:** The regex logic is delicate and handles untrusted input
- **State Management:** Altering the data flow could introduce bugs or race conditions
- **Script Execution:** Any addition of user script execution or dynamic eval operations
