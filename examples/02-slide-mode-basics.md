# Slide Mode Basics

This file demonstrates the **happy path** of slide mode in Markdown Presentation Tool. Because it contains `<!-- slide -->` delimiters, each section wrapped in a delimiter pair becomes one slide with full markdown rendering.

For edge cases (preamble handling, empty pairs, tall slides with Shift+scroll), see [03-slide-mode-advanced.md](03-slide-mode-advanced.md).

## Text + Flowchart

Here is a simple decision flow:

- Start with a question
- Follow the branches
- Arrive at an outcome

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Great, ship it!]
    B -->|No| D[Debug]
    D --> B
```

<!-- slide -->

## Bulleted List + Sequence Diagram

Key participants in the review process:

1. **Author** opens a pull request
2. **Reviewer** examines the changes
3. **CI** runs automated checks
4. **Author** addresses feedback

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Author
    participant Reviewer
    participant CI
    Author->>Reviewer: Open PR
    Reviewer->>Author: Request changes
    Author->>CI: Push fixes
    CI-->>Reviewer: Checks pass
    Reviewer->>Author: Approve
```

## Mermaid-Only Slide

A slide can contain only a diagram — no heading, no text.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Review: Submit
    Review --> Approved: Accept
    Review --> Draft: Request changes
    Approved --> Published: Deploy
    Published --> [*]
```

<!-- slide -->

## Both Mermaid Fence Syntaxes

Backtick fences (GitHub-style) and Azure DevOps triple-colon fences both work:

::: mermaid
graph LR
    A[Markdown File] --> B[getSlides]
    B --> C{Has delimiters?}
    C -->|Yes| D[splitSlides]
    C -->|No| E[extractMermaidBlocks]
    D --> F[Webview]
    E --> F
:::
